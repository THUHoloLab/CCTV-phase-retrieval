**Authors:** [Yunhui Gao](https://github.com/Yunhui-Gao) (gyh21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) and Liangcai Cao (clc@tsinghua.edu.cn)


## Usage
First download a zip file of the data at [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/350454931548480dad4e/?dl=1) or contact the authors through email. Then unzip file `experiment.zip` at `data/experiment`. It contains five groups of data:

* Groups 1 and 2 are the experimental data of a fabricated phase plate.
* Group 3 is the experimental data of a tissue slide.
* Group 4 is the experimental data of a phase resolution target ([Bechmark Quantitative Phase Microscopy Target](https://www.benchmarktech.com/quantitativephasemicroscop)). 
* Group 5 is the experimental data of an amplitude resolution target ([Thorlabs Positive 1951 USAF Test Target](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=4338)).
